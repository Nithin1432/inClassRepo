Hello Professor, my name is Nithin Reddy Julakanti and I am a graduate student in computer science department and I completed my undergrad in Information Technology which course work is similar to computer science and the courses include programming in C, Object Oriented Programming, Java, Data Structures and Algorithms, Advanced Data Structures, Software Engineering, Database Management System and web technologies like HTML, HTML5, CSS and I have done a project with my peers ‘Fake account detection in Twitter’ which helps to detect the bots as well as fake accounts and another mini project which is sentimental analysis on tweets of users.
I read your email and I got an idea of how this class is going to be by your detailed explanation in the email and by attending the first class I found a purpose because I always wanted to work as a front end programmer and working with websites is always a pleasure for me, during my undergrad I have done a simple webpages and there I developed my interest for web designing and I am excited to work on a project which will be an app to track the exercise habits and sharing them with friends parallel to the course work. I am looking forward to learn more in this class which will add weightage to my resume.
Thank you for your time and patience.
